## üöÄ Setup and Installation Guide

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine. This guide is designed to be a clean start.

### 1. Prerequisites

-   Python 3.8+
-   `pip` (Python package installer)

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to keep project dependencies isolated.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

3. Install Dependencies
Install all the required Python libraries using the requirements.txt file.
First, create a file named requirements.txt in your project folder and add the following lines:
Generated code
streamlit
python-pptx
python-dotenv
google-generativeai
pexels-api
Pillow
requests
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
Use code with caution.
Now, run this command in your terminal:
Generated bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Use code with caution.
Bash
4. Set Up API Keys
This is the most critical step. The application requires API keys from Google and Pexels.
Create a file named .env in the root of your project folder.
Add your keys to this file in the following format:
Generated code
GEMINI_API_KEY="your_google_ai_studio_api_key_here"
PEXELS_API_KEY="your_pexels_api_key_here"
Use code with caution.
Gemini API Key: Get it from Google AI Studio.
Pexels API Key: Get it for free from the Pexels API site.
‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Application
With your virtual environment active and the .env file configured, run the following command in your terminal:
Generated bash
streamlit run app.py
Use code with caution.
Bash
(Assuming your Python script is named app.py)
Your web browser should automatically open to the application's local URL (e.g., http://localhost:8501).
üí° How to Use the App
Design Template (Highly Recommended):
In PowerPoint, create a presentation with the fonts, colors, and logos you want.
Save this file as a .pptx file.
In the app's sidebar, use the "Upload a Design Template" button to upload this .pptx file.

Content Input:
Paste the text you want to turn into a presentation into the text area.
Generate:
Click the "üöÄ Generate Presentation" button. The app will show its progress through the three stages.
Download:
Once finished, a "‚¨áÔ∏è Download Presentation" button will appear. Click it to save your file.
